# The CrowdLabel Challenge

 **The CrowdLabel Challenge**: Crowdsourcing LLM Feedback \
 by the Technology Innovation Institute, Abudhabi, UAE. \
 [www.tii.ae](https://www.tii.ae/)

## Challenge Brief
 In this Challenge, TII is looking for new and innovative ways to gather human labeling outputs in a passive way, which would help LLM operators to scale their alignment efforts at much lower costs.

 The alignment must be achieved by passive human labeling, where the task to label a data sample is so ingrained into another process or operation that the human operator may not realize theyâ€™re completing a labeling task.

 In the development and deployment of solutions and data collection stages, for shortlisted participants, it is required that the passive human labeling method is tested and used by a wide variety of users and experts.
